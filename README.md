# Photography Portfolio / Ecomm site

### Quick Demo

Current progress on my site can be seen at:

https://radiant-chamber-14749.herokuapp.com/

> If it takes forever to load, that's normal. Heroku do be like that ;(





### Instructions

If you want to open up the file, run these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbvora03/photos.git

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then you have to create a virtual environment, or Django won't like you

So run these commands:

```
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

Now that you have your virtual environment, go into the `photoportfolio` directory

Next, run this command: 

```
python manage.py runserver
```

### Background

I'm made this site as an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: to put out an EComm site and hopefully gain some passive income, and to get my feet wet in web development. Knowing very little before I started, I managed to understand how to implement various libraries, languages, and frameworks such as:

* Html/CSS/JS
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Django
* and many more
